## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- The general basics of design layout
    - using raw CSS
    - using block, inline-block, and flex display elements
    - understanding of relative positions 
    - Introductory understanding of responsive design for mobile devices 

- How to add Google Fonts to my project
- General understanding of how to use CSS shadowing  

I'm proud that I was able to figure out this CSS:

```css
#price-suffix {
    position: relative;
    top: -6px;
    display: inline-block;
    padding-left: 6px;
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

### Continued development

This solution is a very basic, static Webpage, with only minimum responsive design
features. I'll enhance it going forward to incorporate responsive flex boxes.
